### Hey there!

I'm Margulan, software engineer from Kazakhstan 🇰🇿

Few things about me:
- iOS and Swift enthusiast 🍎
- I like reading books in general, and articles about architecture or low-level concepts 🍀
- I love cherry pies and cheesecakes 🥧
- Probably watching kpop or reading webtoons on breaks 🐹
